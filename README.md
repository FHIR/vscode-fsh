# FSH Language Support for VS Code [DEPRECATED]

This extension is deprecated, and users should install the new identical extension with the identifier [fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FHIR-Shorthand.vscode-language-fsh). Only the publisher name has changed.

If you do not already have this extension installed, please install the fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh version of the extension.

If you do already have this extension installed, it should automatically install the fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh version as a dependency once you are on version 1.17.0. Once the fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh extension is installed, feel free to uninstall this mitre-health.vscode-language-fsh extension, since it is not functional.
