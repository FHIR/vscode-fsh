# FSH Language Support for VS Code [DEPRECATED]

If you do not already have this extension installed, please install the fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh version of the extension.

If you do already have this extension installed, once you update to version 1.17.0, this extension should automatically install the fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh extension and uninstall the outdated extension. If either of step does not happen for an unexpected reason, please manually install the new fhir-shorthand.vscode-language-fsh extension and uninstall this mitre-health.vscode-language-fsh extension, as it is no longer functional and.
